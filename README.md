# LastfmFavToSpotify
It is an application that takes a LastFM username and makes a list of Spotify track IDs of user's favourite songs with which a playlist in Spotify can be made.

Done: working version with GUI. 
TODO: arrange elements in the window, add information about songs processed while generating the playlist.
